To compile, you'll need the open source version of QT4, GNU flex and bison, and the mingw c++ compiler for Win32 or GCC on Unix. 

open a command window (cmd)

type "make clean" and hit enter
type "qmake" and hit enter
type "make" and hit enter 

You'll see an executable called BASIC256 either in this directory or in a "debug" directory, depending on your version of QT.

Also: there is a file called BASIC256.nsi  This is used by the nullsoft scriptable install syatem (2.39 or better) to build a nice Win32 install exe.
