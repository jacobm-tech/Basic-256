To compile on Win32:

NOTE: You'll need the open source version of QT4, GNU flex and bison, and the mingw c++ compiler to compile kidbasic.

open a command window (cmd)
cd to the kidbasic/LEX directory
type "make"
cd to this directory
type "qmake" then "make" for a debug version or "make release" for a release version

The .exe will be built in the appropriate directory (debug or release)


To compile on Linux/Unix:

You'll need QT4 to compile, along with Flex and Bison.

open a command window
cd to the kidbasic/LEX directory
type "make unix"
cd to this directory
type "qmake" then make

The executable will be compiled in this directory and will be called KidBASIC.
