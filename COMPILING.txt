To compile, you'll need the open source version of QT4, GNU flex and bison, espeak development libraries (for *nix), and the mingw c++ compiler for Win32 or GCC on Unix. 

open a command window (cmd)

type "make clean" and hit enter
type "qmake" and hit enter
type "make" and hit enter 

You'll see an executable called BASIC256 either in this directory or in a "debug" directory, depending on your version of QT.

Release Build:
To build a nice WIN32 installer use the nullsoft scriptable install system file
2.39 or better) called BASIC256.nsi.  You must build a release copy of BASCI256.

You must also copy the QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll and mingwm10.dll to the release
folder before testing the build or running the installer script.  Under QT 4.5.3
be sure to use the dlls from C:\Qt\2009.04\qt\bin and not the ones from C:\Qt\2009.04\bin.

make clean
qmake -config release
make release

then run the NSIS script
