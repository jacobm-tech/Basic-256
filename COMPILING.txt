To compile, you'll need the open source version of QT4, GNU flex and bison, and the mingw c++ compiler for Win32 or GCC on Unix. 

open a command window (cmd)
type "qmake" and hit enter
type "make" and hit enter 

You'll see an executable called BASIC256 either in this directory or in a "debug" directory, depending on your version of QT.
