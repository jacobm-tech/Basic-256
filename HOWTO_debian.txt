How to build and upload the "Launchpad" source for ppa.

in ./trunk/debian/changelog insert new version information
 - be sure this follows the format EXACTLY
 - check username is exactly the same as output of gpg --list-secret-keys
 
in ./trunk execute ./ziplinuxsource.sh
 - be sure the version was changed in trunk/Version.h before running this
 - this will create a folder ../basic256-VERSION
 - and a file ../basic256_VERSION.orig.tar.gz

in ./basic256-VERSION execute debuild -S -sa
 - you will need your gpg passphrase (twice)

in . execute dput ppa:basic256/basic256 basic256_VERSION_source.changes
 - this will upload your changes to the server where the build will be queued
