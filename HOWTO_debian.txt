How to build and upload the "Launchpad" source for ppa.

Note:
Be sure to have your ssh key (created with ssh-keygen -t rsa) and your gpg
key (created with gpg--gen-key, registered with ubuntu) in your lanuchpad
user configuration.

1) in ./trunk execute ./ziplinuxsource.sh
 - be sure the version was changed in trunk/Version.h before running this
 - this will create a folder ../basic256-VERSION
 - and a file ../basic256_VERSION.orig.tar.gz

2) in ./trunk/debian/changelog insert new version information
 - be sure this follows the format EXACTLY
 - check username is exactly the same as output of gpg --list-secret-keys

3) in ./basic256_VERSION/debian for the build major version (12-precise, 13-raring/saucy)
 - cp control.xx control
 - cp rules.xx rules

4) test the config by
 - in ./basic256_VERSION execute debuild -us -uc
 - install the .deb file using the package installer
 - check the menu and execution
 - uninstall
 - delete files ./basic256_VERSION-*

5) in ./basic256-VERSION execute debuild -S -sa
 - you will need your gpg passphrase (twice)

6) in . execute dput ppa:basic256/basic256 basic256_VERSION_source.changes
 - this will upload your changes to the server where the build will be queued

7) you may repeat 2-6 multiple times for different builds/packports
