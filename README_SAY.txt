Notes about the SAY statement.

eSpeak available at http://espeak.sourceforge.net must be installed
on the computer before speach synthesis will work.  On Windows computers
the eSpeak filder, typically c:\Program Files\espeak\command_line, needs
to be added to the PATH system environment variable.
