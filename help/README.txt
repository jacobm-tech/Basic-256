The doc folder contains several folders folders:

./[de|en|fr|ru|es]
 - the html and image files that will be distributed with the windows installer
   these dosuments should not be edited but are generated by the wiki2html.kbs
   program

media/[de|en|fr|ru|es]
 - these folders should mirror the docuwiki folders at wiki/data/media/[de|en|fr|ru]
   and should contain the image files used for each of the languages

pages/[de|en|fr|ru|es]
 - these folders should mirror the docuwiki folders at wiki/data/pages/[de|en|fr|ru]
   and coutain the plain text source of the wiki pages writen in the docuwiki
   layout.


To build current off-line help:

1) download from the docuwiki server
1.a) wiki/data/media/[de|en|fr|ru|es] to doc/help/media/[de|en|fr|ru|es]
1.a) wiki/data/pages/[de|en|fr|ru|es] to doc/help/pages/[de|en|fr|ru|es]

2) with BASIC256 load and run the program wiki2html.kbs.  this program will
translate the docuwiki formatted text files in pages into html and will copy
the required image files from media to the doc/help/language folders.
