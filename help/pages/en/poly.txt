===== Poly =====
==== Format ====
**poly** //numeric array variable//\\
**poly** {x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3 ...}

==== Description ====
Draws a polygon.  The sides of the polygon are defined by the values stored in the array, which should be stored as x,y pairs, sequentially. The length of the array/2 will define the number of points. A polygon may also be specified using a list of x,y pairs enclosed in curly braces {}.

==== Note ====
The number of points in the array argument was removed from the poly statement in version 0.9.4.
