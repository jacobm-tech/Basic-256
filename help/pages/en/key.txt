===== Key =====

key()

==== Description ====
Immediately returns an integer value corresponding to the currently pressed keyboard key.  If no key has been pressed since the last call to the **key** function then the number zero (0) will be returned.

==== Note ====
<code>
if key = 47 then print key
</code>
will not display the desired results, because it's calling key twice in succession, and will return different values each time.  This code will do what you want:
<code>
a = key
if a = 47 then print a
</code>
