==== Description ====
Save the current Graphics Output Window to an image file.\\
By default the image is saved as a Portable Networks Graphics (PNG) file.  You may optionally specify the image type as a "BMP", "JPG", "JPEG", or "PNG".

Sometimes images will be saved with "black" filling where the screen was undrawn.  This is caused by the [[CLG|CLG]] statement setting the background to the color "clear" (transparent).  When the image is saved the transparency is changed to black.  Change your CLG statement to the following:
<code>
color white
rect 0, 0, graphwidth, graphheight
</code>

==== Example ====
<code>
color white
rect 0, 0, graphwidth, graphheight
for t = 0 to 100
   color rand()*256, rand()* 256, rand()*256
   rect rand()*graphwidth, rand()*graphheight,rand()*graphwidth, rand()*graphheight
next t
imgsave "testimgsave1.png"
imgsave "testimgsave2.jpg", "jpg"
</code>
