===== Operators =====
The operators +, -, *, /, ^, %, and \ are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulo, and integer division of their operands, respectively.  Valid operands are numeric constants and/or numeric variables.\\
\\
The = operator is used both for assignment to variables, and to test for equality.  The + operator may be used to perform concatenation of any combination of string constants and string variables.  The : operator can separate multiple statements on a single line.  The ; operator suppresses the new line that is printed from a PRINT statement.  The # operator is a shortcut for the [[rem|Rem]] statement, and is interchangeable with it.\\
