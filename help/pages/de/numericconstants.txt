===== Numeric Constants =====
Numeric constants are any numeric characters, preceded by an optional minus sign to indicate negative numbers, and an optional decimal followed by more numeric characters to indicate floating point values.\\

Positive integer values may also be expressed in binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16).  Precede binary values with 0b (0b1110 = 14), octal with 0o (0o177 = 127), and hexadecimal with 0x (0xff = 255).
