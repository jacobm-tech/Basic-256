<code>
clg
color black
# draw a line across the graphic output
line 0,150,300,150
# where do we start
lastx = 0
lasty = sin(0) * 50 + 150
# now step across the line and draw
for x = 0 to 300 step 5
   angle = x / 300 * 2 * pi
   y = sin(angle) * 50 + 150
   line lastx, lasty, x, y
   lastx = x
   lasty = y
