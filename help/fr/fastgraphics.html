<h1> FastGraphics </h1>
<h2> Format </h2>
fastgraphics
<h2> Description </h2>
Turns fastgraphics mode on, until the program is halted. Fastgraphics mode means that the graphics display is not updated until a REFRESH command is issued. It can be used to significantly speed up complex animations and eliminate flicker.
<h2> Note </h2>
When doing animation, it's recommended to do all of your drawing commands in subroutines and use a single REFRESH command after all drawing has been done for that frame.
