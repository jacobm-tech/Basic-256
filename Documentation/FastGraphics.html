<td class="desc">Turns fastgraphics mode on, until the program is halted. Fastgraphics mode means that the graphics display is not updated until a REFRESH command is issued.  It can be used to significantly speed up complex animations and eliminate flicker.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" class="label">Note</td>
<td class="note">When doing animation, it's recommended to do all of your drawing commands in subroutines and use a single REFRESH command after all drawing has been done for that frame.</td></tr>
